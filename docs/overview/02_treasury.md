# Treasury

The Treasury is a key component of the Olympus protocol. The Treasury represents all assets owned and controlled by the protocol.

The primary responsibility of the Treasury is to ensure OHM liquidity on open markets and stabilize OHM with direct market operations in certain situations. 

The treasury is comprised of reserves and OHM liquidity positions, which are held in the on-chain treasury contract. Olympus employs a streamlined treasury management strategy with reserve assets held as sDAI. RBS and Cooler loans access the sDAI as needed for operations, automatically converting to DAI when called for. In the future, additional modules can be granted access via On Chain Governance.
